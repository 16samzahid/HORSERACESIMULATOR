## Getting Started

Welcome to the Horse Racing simulator. This program allows you to simulate a horse.
Begin my declaring a new gui.
You can choose the tracklength and the number of lanes.
You may also have some number of horses less than or equal to the amount of lanes you have
Customise your horses!
Place a bet and see who won to see if you won your bet.
Start race!!
Lastly, be sure to click on the stats button to see the stas for each race you generate.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `src/Horse.java`: the class for the Horse objects
- `src/Race.java`: the class for the Race object
- `src/HorseRaceGUI.java`: the class for the GUI itself

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

Part 2  Horse Race Simulator is not dependent on anything beyond the Java Development Kit. The Swing import is included.
